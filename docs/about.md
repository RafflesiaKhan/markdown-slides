# About Markdown Slides

This project combines the power of MkDocs for documentation with Reveal.js for presentations.

## Why Use Markdown Slides?

- **Simple**: Write everything in Markdown, no HTML knowledge required
- **Flexible**: Create both documentation and presentations in one site
- **Portable**: Deploy to GitHub Pages with ease
- **Responsive**: Works on all devices and screen sizes
- **Beautiful**: Modern design with the Material theme

## How It Works

The system uses MkDocs as the base framework, with special integrations to Reveal.js for the presentation capabilities. When you navigate to a slide page, the Markdown content is automatically transformed into a beautiful presentation.
